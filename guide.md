## Nonprofit Landing Page Structure & Plan

### 1. **Hero Section: The Mission Statement Window**

**Adapt the 10-second rule for nonprofits:**

**Brand Positioning:**

- Keep nonprofit name to 18px maximum (same principle)
- Logo size: 32px maximum in top-left corner
- Choose names that clearly indicate your mission (FeedTheHungry, CleanWaterNow)

**Headlines (36-48px):**
Instead of selling features, address the cause:

- **Bad:** "Donate to Our Organization"
- **Good:** "End Hunger in Our Community" or "Give Clean Water to 1,000 Families"
- Focus on the **impact** and **transformation** you create
- Answer: "Why should someone care about this cause right now?"

### 2. **Trust Signals for Nonprofits**

**Credibility Elements:**

- **Financial Transparency:** "92% of donations go directly to programs"
- **Third-party Validations:** GuideStar ratings, Better Business Bureau accreditation
- **Real Beneficiary Stories:** Photos and names of actual people helped (with permission)
- **Measurable Impact:** "We've provided 50,000 meals this year"

**Language Adaptation:**

- Don't call them "donors"—they're "community champions," "changemakers," or "partners"
- Use authentic stories, never fabricate testimonials

### 3. **Impact Demonstration (Instead of Product Demo)**

**The Hierarchy of Nonprofit Proof:**

1. **Before/After Photos:** Good baseline
2. **Impact Videos:** Better emotional connection
3. **Interactive Impact Map:** Best engagement (showing real-time impact)

**Show transformation:**

- Position impact visuals prominently
- Focus on your most compelling success story
- Show the actual problem being solved

### 4. **Nonprofit-Specific CTA Optimization**

**Donation CTA Best Practices:**

- **Multiple Giving Levels:** $25, $50, $100, $250 options
- **Impact-Focused Language:**
  - "Feed 10 Families" (not "Donate $25")
  - "Provide Clean Water" (not "Give Now")
  - "Save a Life" (not "Contribute")

**Address Common Objections:**

- "Will my money really help?" → Show exact impact per dollar
- "Is this organization legitimate?" → Display transparency ratings
- "Can I afford it?" → Offer monthly giving options
